We propose a strongly performing method that scales to such datasets by simultaneously learning to optimize precision at the top of the ranked list of annotations for a given image and learning a low-dimensional joint embedding space for both images and annotations. Our method, called WSABIE, both outperforms several baseline methods and is faster and consumes less memory.},
